# Hevelius

![Hevelius](src/assets/images/hevelius.jpg)

This is a web interface (web app) for Hevelius, an astronomy processing software and observatory management system.
It's in the very early stages of development. It requires [hevelius backend](https://github.com/tomaszmrugalski/hevelius-backend)
to be running. There's also the [the runner component](https://github.com/tomaszmrugalski/hevelius-runner) that should be
running on a machine that is controlling the telescope. The hevelius-web is not interacting with the runner directly.

The software is implemented in Angular and Typescript.

## Status

As of April 2025, the following features are available:

- Login
- List of tasks
- Adding new tasks
- Editing tasks (long press a task)
- List of telescopes
- Catalogs (NGC,IC,Messier,Caldwell)

The interface is responsive and should work on any device. It was tested on desktop (Ubuntu 24, Windows), and mobile (iPhone 14 Pro).
